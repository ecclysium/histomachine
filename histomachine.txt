	- First official release
	
	
This SAORI-basic allows a user to make basic histograms, and saves them to a subfolder "graphs" so that the ghost can then display them.
Using the matplotlib Python library.


Arguments:
	* Word Color - ex "orange"
		A descriptive color name for the words in the graph. It supports anything used in HTML, such as things like "burlywood", and other names found here. 
		https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/
		Alternately, hex codes may be used.
		
	* Bar Color - ex "orange"
		A descriptive color name, following the same requirements as the above. The color of the histogram bars.
		
	* Group Names - ex "groupnameone,groupnametwo"
		A comma-delimited list of the names of the groups for the histogram.
		
	* Heights - ex "12,45"
		A comma-delimited list of the height numbers for each histogram bar, in the same order as the last argument.
		
	* Title - ex "What A Great Histogram Name"
		Any name that you would like the histogram to display on it to describe the data.
		
	* File Name - ex "histogram.png"
		The filename that the program will save the image to. 
		
	* DPI - ex 100
		The size of the image. 100 is probably too large to display in most balloons, so consider 50 or lower.
